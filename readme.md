Extends xcompose features

Requires default xcompose disabled

Bugs to work:
* Full strings aren't being parsed correctly
* Occasionally some characters aren't being sent properly. Rare bug. Might have to do something with keyboard mapping
* Setup counter of keys to ignore as per string size
* Need exception for when a window is destroyed preventing crash from keyboard monitor
